Hi, I'm a seasoned full-stack developer with over 10 years of experience in software and web development — or as I like to call it, "building useful things with equal parts logic and caffeine."
Professionally, I work on medical software in the field of reproductive medicine. Yes, that means I write code that helps make tiny humans possible. 🧬👶

Until now, my GitHub has been more of a digital ghost town. But that’s about to change.
I'm gradually uploading my private projects — a mix of helpful tools that are production-ready and random fun ideas that came to life somewhere between "just one more beer" and "I should really go to bed."

I’m also working on organizing my documentation and notes into readable, useful README files for everyone. Throughout my career, I’ve faced many questions I couldn’t immediately answer — from “What exactly is CORS and why is it yelling at me again?” to “Why isn’t there a decent plug-and-play audit log system out there?”

This GitHub space is my effort to answer those questions — for myself back then, and maybe for you right now.

Let’s build cool stuff (and document it properly for once).
